\appendix

# Additional stuff

If you need appendix in your thesis then use this file as example (you can add more if you need more) otherwise you should not consider it in your main thesis.

You might put some computer output here, or maybe additional tables.

Note that line 5 must appear before your **first** appendix. But other appendices can just start like any other chapter.
