# Example of Equations

You can write simple equations like this, but they won't be numbered:
$$ E = mc^2 $$
To get numbered equations we need to use LaTex code.  The "align" environment aligns equations at the oint where the & symbol appears below.
\begin{align}
    a &= b + c\\
    y + z &= x
\end{align}


The "equation" environment defines the beginning and end of an equation.  "nonumber" disables numbering for this equation.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        a = & b + c\\
            & + d + e
    \end{split} 
\nonumber
\end{equation}
 
Another example of a simple equation:    
\begin{equation} 
    sinx+cosx=1 
\end{equation}
